## Description
This Team Profile Generator was created so there is one place to see the members in a team, and all of their relevant information. This project helped me learned how to test that I was pulling the correct variables by using the 'jest' package. Each test was ran 2-3 times, catching different mistakes, that would have taken me a lot longer to correct if I hadn't tested my javascript files.

## Installation
* Node.js
* Npm (Inquirer and Jest both need to be installed)

## Usage

After pulling/cloning the whole repo, move into the correct file in the terminal. Ensure both 'inquirer' and 'jest' are installed with the 'npm' function. Running node on the index file will lead to the prompts being asked about members of your team. The default questions being asked, regardless of position, are for the employee's name, ID number, and email. Each position will also have respective unique questions to answer for them. When the user has confirmed they won't be adding more members, a new HTML file will be created in the 'result' folder, and will include all answers the user input into the prompt.
